# Tic-Tac-Toe Minimax using graphics.h
Can you beat my tic-tac-toe? __I bet you can't__
## How-to
Just run the `main.exe` or compile `main.cpp` by yourself. </br>
You can change the first player by changing the `currentPlayer` variable between `ai` and `human`.
## Requirement
If you want to re-compile, you need this:
```
$ WinBGIm
```
